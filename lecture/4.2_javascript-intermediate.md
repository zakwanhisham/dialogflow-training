# JavaScript Tutorial for Intermediate

**Welcome to the JavaScript Tutorial for Intermediate!** This tutorial will cover more advanced JavaScript concepts to take your skills to the next level.
Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

---

### Lesson 1: Advanced Functions

- In this lesson, we'll explore advanced function concepts, such as closures, higher-order functions, and function curyying.
- _Example:_

  - **Closures**

  ```javascript
  function outerFunction() {
    const outerVariable = "I am from outer function";

    function innerFunction() {
      console.log(outerVariable);
    }
    return innerFunction;
  }
  const innerFn = outerFunction();
  innerFn(); // Output: "I am from outer function"
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - `innerFunction` is a closure that has access to its parent function's (i.e., `outerFunction`) scope even after the parrent function has finished executing.
  - The returned `innerFunction` retains the reference to the `outerVariable`, allowing it to log the value when invoked.

---

### Lesson 2: Promises and Async/Await

- Asynchronous programming is crucial in modern JavaScript. We'll cover Promises and the newer, more expressive Async/Await syntax.
- _Example:_

  - **Promises**

  ```javascript
  function fetchData() {
    return new Promis((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const data = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
        if (data.length > 0) {
          resolve(data);
        } else {
          reject("Data not found");
        }
      }, 1000);
    });
  }

  fetchData()
    .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```

  - _Explanation:_

    - `fetchData()` return a Promise that resolves after a 1-second delay, simulating fetching data asynchronously.
    - `.then()` is used to handle the resolved data, while `.catch()` handles any errors.

---

- **Async/Await**

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promis((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
      if (data.length > 0) {
        resolve(data);
      } else {
        reject("Data not found");
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
}

async function fetchAndLogData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

fetchAndLogData();
```

- _Explanation:_
  - `fetchAndLogData()` is an asynchronous function that uses `await` to wait for the Promise returned by `fetchData()` to resolve or reject.
  - `try-catch` is used to handle both successful data retrieval and any errors that might occur.

---

### Lesson 3: Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)

- In this lesson, we'll explore Object-Oriented Programming principles and techniques in JavaScript.
- _Example:_

  - **Creating Classes**

  ```javascript
  class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
      console.log(
        `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`
      );
    }
  }

  const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
  const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

  person1.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old"
  person2.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old"
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - We create a `Person` class with a constructor to initialize `name` and `age` properties.
  - The `greet()` method is added to the class, allowing instances to greet themselves.

---

### Lesson 4: Prototypes and Inheritance

- In this lesson, we'll explore prototypes and how inheritance works in JavaScript.
- _Example:_

  - **Prototypes**

  ```javascript
  function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  Person.prototype.greet = function () {
    console.log(
      `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old`
    );
  };

  const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
  const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

  person1.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old"
  person2.greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old"
  ```

  - _Explanation:_

    - We create a constructor function `Person` and add the `greet()` method to its prototype.
    - Instances created with `new Person()` share the same `greet()` method through the prototype chain.

---

- **Inheritance**

```javascript
function Employee(name, age, position) {
  Person.call(this, name, age);
  this.position = position;
}

Employee.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Employee.prototype.constructor = Employee;

Employee.prototype.info = function () {
  console.log(
    `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}, Position: ${this.position}`
  );
};

const empoyee1 = new Employee("Alice", 30, "Manager");
employee1.info(); // Output: "Name: Alice, Age: 30, Position: Manager"
employee1.greet(); // Output: "Hello my name is Alice and I am 30 years old"
```

- _Explanation:_
  - We create an `Employee` constructor function that inherits properties from `Person` using `Person.call(this, name, age)`.
  - We set `Employee`'s prototype to a new object created with `Object.create(Person.prototype)`, establishing the prototype chain.
  - Instances of `Employee` have access to both `info()` and `greet()` methods.

---

### Lesson 5: Module Bundlers

- In this lesson, we'll explore using module bundlers like Webpack to manage dependencies and buld JavaScript applications.
- _Example:_

  - **Using Webpack**
  - Assuming you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed, follow these steps:

    1. Create a new project folder and navigate to it in the terminal.
    2. Run `npm init -y` to initialize a new `package.json` file with default settings.
    3. Install Webpack and its CLI globally: `npm install -g webpack webpack-cli`.
    4. Create two files: `src/index.js` and `src/greet.js`.

    ```javascript
    // src/greet.js
    export function greet(name) {
      return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    import { greet } from "./greet";

    const message = greet("Alice");
    console.log(message); // Output: "hello, Alice"
    ```

    - Run `webpack src/index.js dist/main.js` to bundle the code an create a `dist` folder containing the bundled file.

- _Explanation:_
  - We use Webpack to bundle `src/index.js` and its dependencies (in this case `src/greet.js`) into a single file(`dist/ main.ja`).
  - The `index.js` file uses the `import` statement to import the `greet()` function from the `greet.js` module.
