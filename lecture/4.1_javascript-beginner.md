# JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners

**Welcome to the JavaScript Tutorial for Beginners!** JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that allows you to add interactivity and dynamic content to websites.
In this tutorial, we'll cover the fundamentals of JavaScript with code examples to help you get started on your coding journey.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of `HTML` and `CSS`.

---

### Lesson 1: Introduction to JavaScript.

- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language that runs on browsers to make web pages interactive.
- _Example:_
  - Create a simple `HTML` page with a JavaScript script that displays an alert when the page loads.
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello, JavaScript</h1>
      <script>
        alert("Welcome to JavaScript!");
      </script>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```
- _Explanation:_
  - The `<script>` tag is used to include JavaScript code in an HTML page.
  - The `alert()` function displays an alert dialog with the message **"Welcome to JavaScript!"** when the page is loaded.

### Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

- Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. JavaScript has several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, array, and objects.
- _Example:_

  - Declare variables of different data types and print their values to the console.

  ```javascript
  let age = 30;
  const name = "John";
  let isStudent = true;
  let favoriteFruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
  let person = { firstName: "Alice", lastname: "Smith" };

  console.log(age);
  console.log(name);
  console.log(isStudent);
  console.log(favoriteFruits);
  console.log(person);
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - We declared variables `age`, `name`, `isStudent`, `favoriteFruits`, and `person` with different data types: number, string boolean, array, and object.
  - We used `console.log()` to print the values of these variables to the browser console.

### Lesson 3: Operators and Expressions

- Operators are used for performing operations on variables and values.
- _Example:_

  - Perform basic arithmetic operations and use comparison and logical operators.

  ```javascript
  let a = 10;
  let b = 5;

  // Arithmetic operators
  let sum = a + b; // 15
  let difference = a - b; // 5
  let product = a * b; // 50
  let quotient = a / b; // 2

  // Comparison  operators
  let isEqual = a === b; // false
  let isGreater = a > b; // true

  // Logical operators
  let isTrue = true;
  let isFalse = false;

  let result1 = isTrue && isFalse; // false
  let result2 = isTrue || isFalse; // true
  let result3 = !isTrue; // false
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - Arithmetic operators are used for basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - Comparison operators are used to compare values (equal, greater than, etc.).
  - Logical operators are used to combine or negate conditions (AND, OR, NOT).

### Lesson 4: Control Floe - Condtional Statements

- Condtional statements allow you to make decisions in your code.
- _Example:_

  - Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to control the flow of code execution.

    ```javascript
    let temperature = 25;

    if (temperature > 30) {
      console.log("It's a hot day!");
    } else if (temperature > 20) {
      console.log("It's a pleasant day.");
    } else {
      console.log("It's a bit chilly.");
    }
    ```

- _Explanation:_
  - We use the if statement to check if the temperature is greater than 30, and if true, it logs "It's a hot day!".
  - If the condition is false, the else if statement checks if the temperature is greater than 20 and logs "It's a pleasant day." if true.
  - If neither of the above conditions is true, the else statement logs "It's a bit chilly.".

### Lesson 5: Control Flow - Loops

- Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.
- _Example:_

  - Use `for` and `while` loops to print numbers from 1 to 5.

  ```javascript
  // Using for loop
  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  // Using while loop
  let count = 1;
  while (count <= 5) {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
  }
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - The for loop runs the code block for i values from 1 to 5, incrementing i by 1 in each iteration.
  - The while loop runs the code block as long as the count variable is less than or equal to 5, incrementing count by 1 in each iteration.

---

### Lesson 6: Functions

- Funtions are blocks of reusable code that can be called multiple times.
- _Example:_

  - Create a function to calculate the area of a rectangle and call it with different values.

  ```javascript
  function calculateRectangleArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
  }

  let area1 = calculateRectangleArea(5, 10);
  let area2 = calculateRectangleArea(7, 3);

  console.log(area1); // 50
  console.log(area2); // 21
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - We define the calculateRectangleArea() function, which takes width and height as parameters and returns their product (area).
  - We call the function with different values and store the results in variables area1 and area2.
  - The function is called with (5, 10) and (7, 3), and it returns the corresponding areas, which are then printed to the console.
