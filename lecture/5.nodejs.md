# Node.js Tutorial

Node.js is a powerful server-side JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable and high-performance applications.
In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of Node.js and explore its various features. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

- Basic undestanding of JavaScript and web development concepts.
- Node.js intalled on your machine. You can dowload it from the official Node.js website.

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Node.js

- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. It uses Google's V\* JavaScript engine to convert JavaScript code into machine code, making it fast and efficient.
- _Example:_

  - Create a simple "Hello, Node.js!" script and run it using Node.js.

  ```javascript
  // hello.js
  console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - We used the `console.log()` function to print "Hello, Node.js!" to console.
  - To run the script, open the terminal, navigate to the directory cantaining the `hello.js` file, and type `node hello.js`. You should see the message printed in the terminal.

### Lesson 2: Working with Modules

- Node.js has a modulaar architecture, and it allows you to split your code into reusable modules. Modules encapsulate related functionality, making your code more organized and maintainable.
- _Example:_

  - Create a simple module that exports a function to calculate the square of a number.

  ```javascript
  // math.js
  function square(number) {
    return number * number;
  }

  module.exports = square;
  ```

  - Now, create another file to use the module:

  ```javascript
  // app.js
  const square = require("./math.js");

  console.log(square(5)); // Output: 25
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - In `math.js`, we defined a function `square()` to calculate the square of a number and exported it using `module.exports`.
  - In `app.js`, we imported the `square` function using `require()` and used it to calculate the square of 5.

### Lesson 3: NPM(Node Package Manager)

- NPM is the package manager for Node.js, and it allows you to easily install and manage external libraries (packages) for your Node.js projects.
- _Example:_

  - Install the `lodash` package using NPM and use it in your project.

  ```bash
  npm install lodash
  ```

  ```javascript
  // app.js
  const _ = require("lodash");

  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const sum = _.sum(numbers);
  console.log(sum); //Output: 15
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - We installed the `lodash` package using the command `npm install lodash`.
  - In `app.js`, we used `require()` to import the `lodash` library and used the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of an array of numbers.

### Lesson 4: Asynchronous Programming

- Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous operations efficiently using non-blocking I/O operations. This allows Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking the event loop.
- _Example:_

  - Create a simple asynchronous function using `setTimeout()`.

  ```javascript
  // app.js
  function delayedGreeting() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Hello after 2 seconds!");
    }, 2000);
  }

  delayedGreeting();
  console.log("hello immediately");
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - The `delayedGreeting()` function sets a timer using `setTimeout()` to print "hello after 2 seconds!" after a delay of 2000 miliseconds (2 seconds).
  - While waiting for the timer to complete, Node.js continues to executes other code. Therefore, "hello immediately!" is printed before the delayed greeting.

---

### Lesson 5: Creating a Simple HTTP Server

- Node.js comes with built in modules that make it easy to create an HTTP Server and handle HTTP requests.
- _Example:_

  - Create a simple HTTP server that responds with "Hello, World!" to all requests.

  ```javascript
  // server.js
  const http = require("http");

  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Hello, World!");
  });

  const port = 3000;
  server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
  ```

- _Explanation:_
  - We used the `http` module to create an HTTP server using `http.createServer()`.
  - The server listens on port 3000, and when a request is received, it responds with "Hello, World!" and set the response header to `Content-Type: text/plain`.

## Conclusion:

Congratulations! You've completed the NOde.js tutorial. You've learned the basic of Node.js, including running scripts, working with modules, using NPM, handling asynchronous programming, and creating an HTTP server.
With this knowledge, you're well-equipped to build more complex applications using Node.js. Keep exploring and experimenting with Node.js to become a proficient backend developer. Happy coding!
